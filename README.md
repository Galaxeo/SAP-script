SAP Script - Python script made to take an input (in our case, phone #s or IPs), search a CSV (spreadsheets WIP), and output the corresponding values (which in our case were phone locations/positions) that are sorted in a way to assist the interns' workflows. While doing this, I learned how to use the Google Sheets API and the Google Cloud Console at a very basic level, while also attempting to implement pandas, but instead used a dictionary as given by the gspread package when collecting data from a speadsheet. [Reminder to self to upload updated version with Google Sheets API when home at desktop]
