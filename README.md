# Justin's Projects
Some of the projects I've done

SAP Script - Python script made to take an input (in our case, phone #s or IPs), search a CSV (spreadsheets WIP), and output the corresponding values (which in our case were phone locations/positions) that are sorted in a way to assist the interns' workflows.
